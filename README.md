# Badge Magic

![Badge Magic – LED Badge Designer](repo-image.png)

**Design and send messages to FOSSASIA LED name badges from your browser.** No app required—create animated text, pick from hundreds of pixel-art icons, and preview on a live 11×44 grid before connecting via Web Bluetooth or the Badge Magic app.

## What’s in this repo

- **Web app** (`app.js`, `index.html`) – Design badges in the browser: enter text, choose effects and speed, pick from hundreds of pixel-art icons, and see a live LED-style preview. Uses the **Web Bluetooth API** to connect and send data to compatible LED badges directly from the browser—no native app install required.
- **SVG assets** – Pixel-art icons in `assets/vectors/` are bundled into `svgAssets.js` for the icon picker.
- **badge-magic-android/** – [Badge Magic](https://github.com/fossasia/badgemagic-app) Android (and cross‑platform) app for saving and sending badges to devices over Bluetooth. See that folder’s README for build and run instructions.

## Web Bluetooth

This project uses the [Web Bluetooth API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Bluetooth_API) to discover and connect to FOSSASIA LED badges from the browser. When you click **Connect & Send**, the page requests a Bluetooth device; after you pick your badge, it sends the current design (text, effects, icon) over BLE. No app store install is required—just open the site over **HTTPS** (or `localhost`) in a [supported browser](https://caniuse.com/web-bluetooth) (e.g. Chrome, Edge, Opera on desktop and Android).

## Quick start (web)

1. Serve the project root over HTTP (e.g. `npx serve .` or any static server). For Web Bluetooth, use HTTPS or `localhost`.
2. Open the page and use the controls to set message, effect, speed, and optional icon.
3. Use the preview to see the result, then click **Connect & Send** to pair with your badge via Web Bluetooth, or export and use the Badge Magic app to send.

## GitHub Pages

You can host the web app on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for free.

1. Push this repo to GitHub.
2. Open the repo **Settings → Pages**.
3. Under **Build and deployment**, set **Source** to **Deploy from a branch**.
4. Choose your default branch (e.g. `main`) and **/ (root)** as the folder, then Save.
5. After the first deploy, the site will be at `https://<username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`.

A `.nojekyll` file in the root tells GitHub Pages to serve the site as static files (no Jekyll build).

## Regenerating icon assets

Icons in `assets/vectors/*.svg` are compiled into `svgAssets.js`:

```bash
node scripts/generate-svg-assets.js
```

Run this after adding or changing SVGs in `assets/vectors/`.
